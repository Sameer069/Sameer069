    <center id="info"><h1 style="font-style: lighter;">We are currently engaged in reaching out to the daily wage earners and underprivileged families, residing in India, with food, masks and soaps.  With no income during nation-wide lockdown, these families lost access to the most basic necessity - food. Countless have been going without food for days and their very survival is now at risk. Our efforts are now focused on their health and safety. While our food kits of rations rice, pulses, potatoes, oil, salt and biscuits are providing them with sustenance, the masks and soaps are protecting them against the virus.

                    With the parents being labor workers on daily wages it is very difficult to address any major illness if it came their way so there is a need for a Medical fund to make it easy for those who succumb to any major illnesses.

                It was noticed by our social workers the children who attended the local schools would not pay much attention to the material taught, as a result when they joined private schools after the 7th std they could not cope with the studies this led to a substantial increase in the number of drop outs.

                    Jeevan Dhara observed there were many students who would drop out after their higher secondary. This was due to either lack of funds to pursue higher education, outright lack of interest in studies or they were just unaware about the opportunities available to them.
